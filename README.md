1. After cloning this repo, install the node modules for both the frontend and the backend. Sorry, I forgot to add a script to do this from the main directory. Hopefully, I will update this soon.
2. Next, go back to the main directory, use the dev script `npm run dev` to execute both the frontend and backend simultaneously.
